>Regarding the bad customer service you've received, there is a specific reason why companies often decline to comment on fraud security checks: by allowing you a way of recourse, they would be disclosing information about how their system works, which makes it potentially vulnerable to attackers. For example, if they said "sure, just send us a copy of your driver's license and we'll lift the ban", this would be a signal for fraudsters to try to fake such documentation.
