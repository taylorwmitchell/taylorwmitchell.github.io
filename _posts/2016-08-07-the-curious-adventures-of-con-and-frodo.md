Cute article about how emoji and stickers can act similarly to non-verbal cues.

I found this part about the creation of stickers for LINE quite interesting:
> ... created Line in six weeks to communicate with each other across a network with much-reduced bandwidths. James Kim, who managed the design of its first sticker set, says that as the app was developed rapidly, it struggled to transfer photos and videos; when it was released to the public, it compensated for this by offering users large emoji to send each other instead.
