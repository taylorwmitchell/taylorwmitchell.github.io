ie "What does 16.7 million colours look like"

Now I want a monitor that can display a 4096 * 4096 image at full resolution.

If you're wondering what Joco is referring to by bit depth, [>this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#True_color_.2824-bit.29) has good image examples.

For more full RGB colour images, see [>this StackExchange post.](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/22144/images-with-all-colors)
