Really shows the importance of using a password manager. 

I use [>KeePass](http://keepass.info/). It's open source and the Android client, [>Keepass2Android,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android) has a great feature: 
when detecting a site you have a password for, it automatically shows a notification which copies your username/password to the clipboard.

It's actually more convenient than typing a password.
