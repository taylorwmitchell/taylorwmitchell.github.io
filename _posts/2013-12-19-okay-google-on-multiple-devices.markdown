>Let’s say I’m on my computer, but my phone is in my pocket, my tablet is on my desk, and maybe I’m wearing a pair of Google Glass. How will a device know that I’m talking to it? If I’m searching for something on my computer, how will my phone know not to?

How about some clever local networking that compares estimated distance to the sound source?
