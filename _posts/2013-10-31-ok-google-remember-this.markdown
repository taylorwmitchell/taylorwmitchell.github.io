title:  "OK Google, remember this:"

To use the loose change on my desk, I go to the fish and chip shop. The problem is remembering how much everything costs. 
(gotta have correct change)

How cool would it be if you could tell google to remember facts via voice search:
>"OK Google Now, remember that a South Melbourne Dim Sim is $1.20 from the fish and chip shop"

later: 
>"OK Google Now, how much is a South Melbourne Dim Sim?"

>"South Melbourne Dim Sims are $1.20 from the fish and chip shop."

I'm not sure how it would work. The syntax to remember would be along the lines of:

>"remember that (key) is (value) [optional] .. (from/when/at etc.) (second value)"

To retrieve, there could be:

+ "Where did I put my (key)"
+ "Where is (key)"
+ "How much is (key)"
+ "What is (key)"

[if something has been remembered, it could take precedence over the google result or be shown alongside]
