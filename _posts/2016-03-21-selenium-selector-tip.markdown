title: "Selenium tip: use Chrome's dev tools to get CSS selectors"
---

Sometimes you'll need to select an element which does not have an id or other unique identifier. I'm sure I'm not unique in finding long selectors frustrating to write. It turns out that if you right click an element in Chrome's dev tools and select 'Copy as selector', you'll get a CSS selector. No thinking required!

It's worth noting some of these selectors are not very sane. But they can still be a useful stopgap while waiting for the dev team to insert identifiers.
